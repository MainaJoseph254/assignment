Define Software Engineering:
    ANS: is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
    ANS:  traditional programming focused on writing code to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks while software engineering encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, including planning, design, testing, deployment, maintenance, and project management.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
    ANS: it's a guide on how to do software development.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
    ANS: requirements: the process of acquiring and gathering user needs and system requirements.
    Design: the process of creating detailed designs of the software       achitecture.
    Implementation: its the process of writing the code according to the specifications.
    Testing: the process of testing the coded software to ensure that it meets the quality standards.
    Deployment: releasing the software to users or customers.
    Maintenance: process of updating, and enhancing the software after deploment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
    ANS: agile model is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
    ANS: waterfall model is a sequential approach to software development that follows distinct faces( following a set of life cycle.)

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
    ANS: waterfall project management method is difficult to accomodate changes compared to agile which is easier when it comes to making changes.
    In waterfall in project management method, the testing process happens in the last step while in agile the testing process happens frequently since the whole process is iterative and incremental.
     
Requirements Engineering: 
    ANS: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): softwares that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code.
    Version control systems: software tools for tracking changes to source code coordinating work among team members.
    Testing Framework: libraries and frameworks for automating the testing process and ensuring software quality.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
    ANS: requirements is the process of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

Software Design Principles:
    ANS: single Responsibility Principle
         open/ closed principle
         Liskov Substitution Principle
         Interface segragation principle
         Dependency Inversion Principle


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
    ANS: Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into separate, self-contained components, or modules, each of which encapsulates a specific functionality. 

Testing in Software Engineering:
    ANS: is the process of ensuring that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.
